# cleveranomaly's General Programming Convention
Latest edit: October 4th, 2021. Original edition.

## Preamble
Each programming language has their own distinctive **set of guidelines** (practices, customs, etc). Most of them are derived from [C](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), which poses difficulties for programmers from [C](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))-based programming languages hard to adapt to a new programming language (e.g. [C#](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language))). This programming convention aim to solve the problem above by creating a universal programming practices, applicable to not just [C](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))-based programming languages.<br>
Besides unique conventions per programming language, everyone has their own opinions on their "preferable" codestyle. Many choose to use inline braces, while others use an open brace on a new line. This convention is also targeted towards such problem by specifying a general codestyle which can be expanded upon and used in distinct languages.
