# cleveranomaly's General Programming Convention
Latest edit: October 4th, 2021. Original edition.

## Preamble
Each programming language has their own distinctive **set of guidelines** (practices, customs, etc). Most of them are derived from C, which poses difficulties for programmers from C-based programming languages hard to adapt to a new programming language (e.g. C#). This convention aims to solve the problem above by creating a universal programming practices, applicable to not just C-based programming languages.<br>
Besides unique conventions per programming language, each individual have their own thoughts of the "best" codestyle. Many choose to use inline braces, while others use an open brace on a new line. This convention specifies general codestyle which can be expanded upon and applied to various (programming, markup, etc) languages.

## Object-oriented programming (OOP)
**[OOP](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)** builds upon the concept of "objects", which can withhold data and code. Data can be represented in multiple forms (including, but not limited to numbers, strings, etc) and code represents functions or methods (class functions).<br>
